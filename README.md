# Real-Time Yoga Pose Classification and Dynamic Sequence Recommendations Using CNN-Based Computer Vision

Justin Mao, Rithvik Srinivas, Saanvi Arora, Sophia Zou, William Brownstead

This paper presents an AI-driven yoga assistant that combines real-time pose recognition with dynamic pose sequence recommendations through a lightweight computer vision pipeline. Utilizing the Yoga-82 dataset and fine-tuning a MobileNetV2 classifier, our system achieves 78.4% accuracy on the test set while ensuring balanced performance across different pose classes by applying data cleaning, class rebalancing, and augmentation techniques. To enable real-time feedback, we integrate the model with live webcam input, implementing logic for detecting pose correctness over time and suggesting appropriate next poses based on the selected difficulty level. The pipeline is optimized for CPU performance, making it accessible to users without the need for specialized hardware. The result is a responsive, pose-aware yoga assistant designed for home practice and personal use.
